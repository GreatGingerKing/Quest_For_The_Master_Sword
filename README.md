# Quest_For_The_Master_Sword
This is just a game I'm making to help me learn python. 

Should be 4 python files and 2 text files.
Version 2 is now up. Created to be much more object oriented. In addtion, each room now calls something and it's random between
a monster, a treasure chest and a riddle. Probably need more riddles, and would like things to get harder as you get close, but It's basically a fully functioning game at this point.
